# Auction contract: find the flaws

In this contract, some users may bid for the chance to buy an item, before some deadline.

After the deadline, the owner of the contract may collect the highest bid.

Users who didn't win the auction may get the tokens from their bids back.

Find the flaws!

A test scenario is given, for a situation where everything goes well.

But you also need to test the cases where someone tries to cheat.

For each flaw you find, add a test that shows it, then find a way to fix the flaw.
