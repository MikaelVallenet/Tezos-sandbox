# Verifications

Write a contract that stores an integer, and other information you may need.

Anyone should be able to add to this counter, a positive value that is lower than 10.

The same person should not be able to add twice in a row. Someone else has to call it in between.

Only the owner of the contract may subtract a value. The owner may also reset the value to 0.
