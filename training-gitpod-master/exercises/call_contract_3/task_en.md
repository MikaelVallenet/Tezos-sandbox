# Exercise : call a contract 2

You should have been given the address of a contract for this task.

Start by setting an alias for this contract.

Then, call that smart contract, by providing your firstName as a parameter.

This smart contract takes a string as a parameter. Make sure you use double quotes around the value of the string, and single quotes around the parameter as a whole, for exemple: '"hello"'

Warning: on Tezos, should not contain any accented characters.

Then, go check the contract on https://better-call.dev/
